== ARGUMENTS ==


-d::
	Debug. Display files name while scanning.

-e::
	Execute, effectively make hard-links (Default is dry-run).

-i::
	Interactive. Ask the user for each hard-linkable files.

-m size::
	While comparing files, limit file size to first 'size' KiB.
	This can accelerate a lot on large files such as music and video files.

-v::
	Verbose.

dir::
	The directory to scan, default is the current.

== DESCRIPTION ==

This tool analyzes a sub-tree and suggest you a list of files that could be hard-linked.

Hard-links can save space on a file-system. 
It sometimes happens that copies of the same files exists under different name in 
different directory of a user subtree, often multimedia files.
Hard-links are also often lost after a network copy of a sub-tree.

The default behavior is a dry-run and just output a list of `ln` commands that could be issued, 
and can be used safely.
